Certainly! Here are the steps to guide the user when trying to run your repository:

1. Install MetaMask:
   - Visit the MetaMask website at https://metamask.io/.
   - Download and install the MetaMask extension for your preferred web browser.
   - Follow the setup instructions to create a new MetaMask wallet or import an existing one.
   - Ensure you have an Ethereum account in MetaMask that you will use for testing.

2. Install Ganache:
   - Go to the Ganache website at https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/.
   - Download and install Ganache for your operating system.
   - Launch Ganache and create a new workspace or use the default one.
   - The workspace should provide you with testing accounts that have Ethereum balances.

3. Open Remix IDE:
   - Access the Remix IDE by visiting https://remix.ethereum.org/ using a web browser.

4. Add Candidates:
   - Locate the `admin_add_candidate.ejs` form in the admin folder of your repository.
   - Use this form to add candidates through the `addCandidate` function in `voters.sol`.
   - Make sure you are connected to the correct Ethereum network on MetaMask (such as the Ganache network).

5. Compile and Deploy Smart Contract:
   - In Remix IDE, create a new Solidity file (e.g., `file.sol`) and paste the smart contract code into it.
   - Compile the smart contract by selecting the appropriate Solidity version and clicking the "Compile" button.
   - Once successfully compiled, go to the "Run" tab in Remix.
   - Select "Injected Web3" as the environment to connect to MetaMask.
   - Import your Ganache wallet into MetaMask using the private key of one of the testing accounts.
   - Deploy the smart contract by clicking the "Deploy" button, and confirm the deployment in MetaMask.

6. User Interface:
   - Access the `candidate.ejs` file, which serves as the user interface for triggering the voting function.
   - Make sure you have MetaMask installed and connected to the Ganache network.
   - Ensure your MetaMask wallet has access to vote by using the `give_right_to_vote` function in `voters.sol`.
   - The user interface should verify if the user's MetaMask address has the right to vote and prevent duplicate voting.
   - Trigger the voting function in the smart contract through the user interface.
   - We have added several pages in user page where he/she can view candidates slogan and campaign.

7. Display Voting Results:
   - After voting, the smart contract should have a function (e.g., `votecount`) to count the votes.
   - Create a file called `result.ejs` that will display the voting results.
   - Implement the logic in `result.ejs` to fetch the vote count from the smart contract and display it to the user.

These steps should guide the user through the process of running this repo by using node.js run your index.js file as
nodemon index.js file also when updating smart contract dont forget to update the ABI and contract address in 
candidate.ejs and constant.js
